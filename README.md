# DEV277x-Mod1-Battleships
Classwork - Quick 1 Peg Battleship Game

This is my quick Battleship game for my DEV277x class (Object Oriented Programming in Java). This is the Module 1 Project "Battle Ships". Feel free to help trim down the code.

Perhaps we can turn this into a multiplayer game of some sort?
